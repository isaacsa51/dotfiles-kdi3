#  KDE Plasma + i3 Gaps

  

As the screenshot above these are my dotfiles that are needed to configure your desktop as above, all screenshots was captured with Flameshot, because the PRNT SCRN key doesn't work.

  

##  How do you setup KDE & i3?

  

All the process can be found inside this [repo](https://github.com/heckelson/i3-and-kde-plasma "Repository from Heckelson").

  

**NOTE:** If you want all my i3 config the process of compatibily are already in my i3 config so you don't need to do it again. The only thing that you need to do are install all the requirements.

  

###  Requirements

  

To make this dotfiles work you need those programs:

  

- Manajaro KDE *obviously*

- Alacritty

- i3 gaps *in the instructions of the repo to setup KDE & i3 also tells that*

- SF Pro Text & JetBrains Mono *Those aren't programs, but in this setup are heavily used*

- Picom

  

##  Installation

After completing all steps from the repo that I linked above, then you only have to paste all the stuff ***make a backup first just in case*** in your home directory and that's all.

## GTK themes used
  - Plasma Theme: Silicon
  - GTK 2/3: Breeze
  - Icons: Vimix or Goqir
 
 This info was obtained with ``neofetch`` but in the System settings from Plasma I have configured like:
 
 - Global Theme: Silicon
 - Plasma Style: Aura
 - Colors: Aura
